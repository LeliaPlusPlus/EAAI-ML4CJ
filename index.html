<h1>Leveraging Machine Learning to Advance Climate Justice</h1>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p></p>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Summary</td>
    <td>This module provides a curriculum that integrates climate justice and machine learning for practical real-world applications. In particular, it explores the application of interpretable machine learning to urban heat islands as a case study to inform urban planners. The assignments take students through a socially mindful life cycle of applied machine learning by introducing the topic, emphasizing the importance of data exploration prior to modeling, guiding model development, demonstrating how to gain insights into a model through interpretability techniques, highlighting the value of auditing a model’s performance on various populations, and finally reporting about the model insights.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Topics</td>
    <td>”These assignments are relevant to all things trees (e.g., random forests, XGBoost, LightGBM, Explainable Boosting Machines). Moreover, though we provide a ready dataset, we take the student through the data science (i.e., applied machine learning) lifecycle (data exploration, data visualization, and modeling). We introduce students to interpretable machine learning techniques (feature importance, permutation importance, SHAP values, partial dependence plots) that help them take advantage of model insights.  We also introduce algorithmic auditing through the lens of model evaluation (i.e., comparison of model performance across groups).”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Audience</td>
    <td>The intended audience of students are those who are familiar with tree methods (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting, etc.) and interested in applied machine learning, especially societal applications. This may include introductory or advanced AI students (see Difficulty section below for more information). Moreover, environmental studies students may be interested in leveraging their domain knowledge in applications, and computing students may be interested in leveraging their technical knowledge for societal benefit. The intended audience of instructors are those who cover tree methods in their course and want to engage their students in real-world applications which are beneficial to society. Ideal instructors for these assignments are passionate about social justice, including climate and environmental justice.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Difficulty</td>
    <td>The difficulty can be adjusted based on the student level. For example, the instructor can use a more advanced method such as XGBoost with Bayesian optimization, a more intermediate method such as random forest with random hyperparameter search, or a simple approach that requires only a couple of lines of code and no hyperparameter tuning such as an Explainable Boosting Machine. Based on the level of difficulty imposed by the instructor, the assignment should take 1-2 weeks to complete.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Strengths</td>
    <td>”The assignment gives students a rare opportunity to understand how to leverage their technical expertise in real-world domains related to climate and social justice. “</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Weaknesses</td>
    <td>The assignment relies mostly on tree methods, though tree methods are the most common approach in applied research across disciplines due to their accessibility and computational efficiency. Moreover, there is always the risk of presenting technocracy as the ultimate form of knowledge to address issues, which can exclude other ways of knowing related to qualitative data or Indigeneity, for example.</td>

    <td>Dependencies</td>
    <td>
        <ul>
        <li>Computing requirements: 1-2 CPUs.</li>
        <li>Programming languages: We provide skeleton code in Python Jupyter Notebooks, but the assignment may be translated to any programming language, including R.</li>
        <li>Operating system: Any</li>
        </ul>

  <tr>
    <td>Variants</td>
    <td>The module allows for various opportunities to align the assignment to the needs of the course. Instructors may easily vary the tree method used within the assignment. They may add or take away the interpretability methods used herein.

The instructor may encourage follow-on assignments through a course project or sharing of datasets related to climate justice.

This curriculum provides opportunities to collaborate locally, nationally, or internationally with organizations to co-design algorithms. Connecting with public organizations can help academic scholarship have real world impact.

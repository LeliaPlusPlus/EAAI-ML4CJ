# Leveraging Machine Learning to Advance Climate Justice

We propose machine learning assignments that engage students in climate justice with urban heat islands as a case study. The first assignment focuses on how disparities in the built environment lead to disparate outcomes in urban heat for low income and BIPOC communities. The second assignment focuses on disparities in both urban heat exposure and urban heat resilience. Our assignments promote civic engagement in AI education through the lens of climate justice with relevance to urban planning, health studies, and resource allocation. Our adaptable assignment is a great resource for instructors across disciplines from computer science to environmental studies. Based on previous research in culturally relevant computing, our assignment may prove useful for engaging and retaining marginalized groups in computing.
